<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> I initially picked DeltaMath to work on because I thought it would be fun to do the links and sign in box. The site also looks fairly simple, but with some complex components, so making it would be interesting for me. I also am learning positioning and dead links with this project. I figured out how to make clickable html elements like a button, with text on it. I also learned about how to create links that change color when you hover over them. </p>

<p> Now to explain how I learned how to position elements. I used nav to position navigation links together, which was perfect since the links on the top were all in one row. It was also essential that I remember the rules of applying classes and id's, since I got a bit confused between how to reference them in the html file. Overall, this project has led me to figure out how to move elements on a page, and create clickable shapes/ links. Not only that, I refreshed my mind on applying fonts and classes/ ids, and many other features that I learned previously. </p>
